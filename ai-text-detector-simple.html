            <div class="clue-header">Clues for Spotting AI-Generated Text</div>
            <div class="clue-item">
                <strong>Formal language:</strong> AI tends to use more formal, academic language compared to human writers who often use more casual or conversational phrasing.
            </div>
            <div class="clue-item">
                <strong>Generic descriptions:</strong> AI often uses vague, general descriptions while humans tend to include specific, vivid details.
            </div>
            <div class="clue-item">
                <strong>Quote handling:</strong> AI often paraphrases or formalizes direct quotes rather than using the original colorful language.
            </div>
            <div class="clue-item">
                <strong>Emotional distance:</strong> AI descriptions of emotional events often sound detached or clinical compared to human writing.
            </div>
            <div class="clue-item">
                <strong>Unnecessary complexity:</strong> AI may use unnecessarily complex sentence structures and vocabulary when simpler ones would work better.
            </div>
            <div class="clue-item">
                <strong>Clinical terminology:</strong> AI tends to use clinical or technical terms (e.g., "lacerations" instead of "cuts").
            </div>
            <div class="clue-item">
                <strong>Wordiness:</strong> AI often uses more words to express what humans would say concisely.

                    <p>Apple has revealed its new iPhone 15 series with a significant price reduction of $100 on all models.

                    <p><strong>How to tell:</strong> The AI text (A) uses formal language like "experienced a significant decline" instead of "tanked" and "allegedly durable windows" instead of simply ""unbreakable" windows." It also paraphrases the direct quote "That wasn't supposed to happen" as "Musk acknowledged the demonstration did not proceed as intended" and uses clinical language like "minor lacerations" instead of "minor cuts."</p>
